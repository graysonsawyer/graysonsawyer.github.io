                <p>Finding parking in and around UofSC campus is something almost every commuter has experienced. At times students either miss class or get parking tickets because students cannot find parking spots in a timely manner. This also contributes to traffic congestion seen around campus. Our solution allows students to find any available parking spots and can potentially help traffic congestion.</p>
